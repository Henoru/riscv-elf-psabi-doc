= Introduction

This specification provides the processor-specific application binary interface
document for RISC-V.

This specification consists of the following three parts:

- Calling convention
- ELF specification
- DWARF specification

A future revision of this ABI will include a canonical set of mappings for
memory model synchronization primitives.
